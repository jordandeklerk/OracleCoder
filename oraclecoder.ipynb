        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project introduces OracleCoder, a cutting-edge QLoRA+ ensemble Large Language Model (LLM) specifically engineered for high-efficiency text-to-SQL conversion. OracleCoder sets itself apart through an innovative two-phase fine-tuning approach. Initially, it employs schema linking to deepen its grasp of database architectures, thereby markedly advancing its SQL generation prowess in the latter phase through adept utilization of the schema's contextual insights. Remarkably, OracleCoder boasts the capability to be both trained and evaluated on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, positioning it as an exceptionally efficient solution for text-to-SQL tasks. This project is based on the [DTS-SQL paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01117.pdf) with several modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Current state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models heavily rely on large proprietary language models like GPT-4, raising concerns about data privacy and cost. To address this, this project proposes decomposing the text-to-SQL task into two simpler sub-tasks: schema linking and SQL generation. By fine-tuning smaller open-source language models separately for each sub-task, they are able to achieve performance comparable to much larger proprietary models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to further explore and extend this decomposed approach. We will investigate techniques to enhance the performance of the individual schema linking and SQL generation stages. This could involve experimenting with different model architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and incorporating additional training data or auxiliary tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we plan to explore improved methods for transferring information between the two stages, such as developing more effective schema representations or using attention mechanisms to better align the output of the schema linker with the input of the SQL generator. Specifically, we will implement the new **LoRA+** method outlined in the [LoRA+ paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12354.pdf). The \"+\" in LoRA+ indicates an improvement over the standard LoRA, specifically by setting different learning rates for the adapter matrices which increases computation time of fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope to develop a text-to-SQL system that rivals the performance of large proprietary models while using only smaller open-source components. This will help democratize access to high-quality text-to-SQL technology and mitigate concerns around privacy and cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project we will be using the [Spider dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08887.pdf) for training. The Spider dataset is a large-scale, complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL dataset. It consists of 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries on 200 databases with multiple tables, covering 138 different domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spider is distinct from most previous semantic parsing datasets in several key ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The databases contain multiple tables and cover different domains, so the dataset tests a system's ability to generalize to both new SQL queries and new database schemas.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The queries are complex, including many SQL clauses like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, INTERSECT, nested queries, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Different complex SQL queries and databases appear in train and test sets, rather than having the same SQL query patterns in both.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. It is significantly larger than most previous semantic parsing datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Experiments with various state-of-the-art semantic parsing models on Spider achieve only up to 12.4% exact matching accuracy, showing that the dataset presents a strong challenge for future research in this area. The dataset and task aim to improve the real-world applicability of text-to-SQL systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Our fine-tuning efforts will be centered around the [m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-6.7B](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-6.7B) model. Check out their [website](https://opencodeinterpreter.github.io/) for a detailed exposition of the model and data. As of March 13, 2024, [m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-33B](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-33B) has claimed the #1 spot on [BigCode Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard) and is also the best performing (small) model (less 7B parameters) on the [EvalPlus coding leaderboard](https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "EvalPlus is a code synthesis evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the functional correctness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By extending the test-cases of the HUMANEVAL benchmark by 80 times, EvalPlus reveals that a significant amount of LLM-synthesized code, previously thought to be correct, actually fails the additional tests, highlighting the importance of comprehensive testing in evaluating the performance of LLMs for code synthesis.

As a rule of thumb, `loraplus_lr_ratio` should be larger when the task is more difficult and the model needs to update its features to learn well. In this case, it helps to make the learning rate slightly smaller (e.g., by a factor of 2) than typical vanilla LoRA learning rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "`loraplus_lr_embedding`: (optional) if LoRA modules are added to embedding layers, you can specify a different learning rate for them. Default value 1e-6.\n",

This method adds random noise to the embedding vectors of the training data during the forward pass of fine-tuning. Specifically, each step of NEFTune begins by sampling an instruction from the dataset, and converting its tokens to embedding vectors. NEFTune then departs from standard training by adding a random noise vector to the embeddings. The noise is generated by sampling iid uniform entries, each in the range $[-1,1]$, and then scaling the entire noise vector by a factor of $\\alpha / \\sqrt{L d}$, where $L$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the embedding dimension, and $\\alpha$ is a tunable parameter. The author's note that the scaling rule was borrowed from the adversarial ML literature, and results in a random vector with an expected Euclidean magnitude of approximately $\\alpha / \\sqrt{3}$.\n",

        "Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific tasks often struggle with accurately assessing uncertainties, leading to overconfidence, poor calibration, and unreliable predictions, especially on new or atypical data. A method commonly employed in the field of computer vision to mitigate such issues involves creating a deep ensemble, where a single model is trained multiple times with different initial starting points.\n",

Therefore, instead of fine-tuning multiple LLMs, we suggest ensembling Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). These adapters enable the formation of large ensembles with nearly the same computational cost as the singular use of the base model. For more context, see [Wang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00035.pdf)."

The model's response is processed to extract the predicted tables.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Precision and Recall**: For each question, we calculate precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of predicted tables that are actually relevant, while recall measures the proportion of relevant tables that are successfully predicted by the model. These metrics provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's performance.\n",

We will then group the results by `District` and count the number of shops with less than 3000 products and the number of shops with more than 10000 products. Finally, we will filter the results to only include districts where both conditions are met. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT s1.District FROM shop s1 JOIN shop s2 ON s1.District = s2.District WHERE s1.Number_products < 3000 AND s2.Number_products > 10000 GROUP BY s1.District ``` This query will return the districts that meet the given conditions.\n",

The template type code with the most number of templates can be determined by ordering the results in descending order and selecting the first row. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT r.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(t.Template_ID) AS num_templates FROM Templates t JOIN Ref_Template_Types r ON t.Template_Type_Code = r.Template_Type_Code GROUP BY r.Template_Type_Code ORDER BY num_templates DESC LIMIT 1\n",

Therefore, we cannot directly answer the question about which grades have 4 or more high schoolers.

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we embarked on an ambitious journey to enhance text-to-SQL generation capabilities through the development of OracleCoder, leveraging the innovative QLoRA+ ensemble approach and schema linking. By decomposing the complex text-to-SQL task into schema linking and SQL generation sub-tasks, we were able to fine-tune smaller, open-source language models efficiently, achieving performance on par with larger proprietary models. This not only addresses concerns around data privacy and cost but also democratizes access to high-quality text-to-SQL technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our experiments with the Spider dataset, a challenging benchmark for text-to-SQL tasks, underscored the potential of our approach. By employing a two-phase fine-tuning strategy, incorporating LoRA+ for efficient adaptation, and exploring the use of noisy embeddings, we aimed to push the boundaries of what's possible with smaller models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The successful training of multiple models with varying learning rates for the LoRA adapters, followed by the creation of an ensemble model, demonstrates a novel way to enhance model performance and reliability. This ensemble approach, adapted for LLMs, showcases a path forward for achieving high accuracy and robustness in text-to-SQL generation without the computational overhead typically associated with large ensembles.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we conclude this project, it's clear that the journey to perfect text-to-SQL generation is ongoing. However, OracleCoder represents a significant step forward, offering a scalable, efficient, and accessible solution. Future work will explore further optimizations, additional ensemble strategies, and the integration of more diverse datasets to continue improving performance and generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project not only contributes to the field of semantic parsing and text-to-SQL generation but also exemplifies the power of community-driven, open-source innovation in advancing the state of the art in natural language processing and database interaction."
