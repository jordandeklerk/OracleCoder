The `UNION ALL` operator is used to combine the results of two separate subqueries, one for source airports and one for destination airports.

"SELECT grade, COUNT(*) as num_students FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY num_students DESC LIMIT 1",Highschooler,SELECT grade FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1,Which grade has the most high schoolers?,network_1
"The question is referring to the ""Highschooler"" table. The ""grade"" column in the ""Highschooler"" table has the data we need to answer the question. We can use the GROUP BY statement to count the number of high schoolers for each grade, and then use the ORDER BY statement to sort the grades in descending order. The first row in the result will have the grade with the greatest number of high schoolers. Here is the SQL query to answer the question: ```sql SELECT grade, COUNT(*) AS num_students FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY num_students DESC LIMIT 1",Highschooler,SELECT grade FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1,Return the grade that has the greatest number of high schoolers.,network_1

"The question is not completely clear. The tables ""Highschooler"", ""Friend"", and ""Likes"" do not directly refer to the ""grade"" column. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the question about which grades have 4 or more high schoolers. However, if we were to create a query that would return the number of students in each grade, we could do that by joining the ""Highschooler"" table with the ""Friend"" and ""Likes"" tables. Then, we could filter the results to only include grades that have 4 or more students. Here's an example of how that might look: ```sql SELECT h.grade, COUNT(*) AS num_students FROM Highschooler h LEFT JOIN Friend f ON h.ID = f.student_id OR h.ID = f.friend_id LEFT JOIN Likes l ON h.ID = l.student_id OR h.ID = l.liked_id GROUP BY h.grade HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4",Highschooler,SELECT grade FROM Highschooler GROUP BY grade HAVING count(*)  >=  4,Which grades have 4 or more high schoolers?,network_1

"To answer this question, you would need to join the `singer` and `song` tables on the `Singer_ID` column. Then, you would group the results by `Name` and sum the `Sales` for each group.
